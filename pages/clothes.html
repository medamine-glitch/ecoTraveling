                    <p>Moroccan clothing is not just about covering the body; it's an expression of identity, social status, and regional belonging. The traditional garments have evolved over centuries, influenced by various civilizations that have left their mark on Morocco's cultural landscape.</p>
                    <p>What makes Moroccan attire special is the preservation of ancient techniques alongside adaptation to contemporary styles. The clothing reflects the country's geographical diversity - from the Atlas Mountains to the Sahara Desert and the coastal regions.</p>
                    <p>Colors, patterns, and embellishments in Moroccan clothing often carry symbolic meanings. Bright colors represent joy and celebration, while specific motifs offer protection or bring good fortune according to traditional beliefs.</p>

                        <p class="clothing-text">The djellaba is a long, loose-fitting outer robe with full sleeves and a pointed hood called a "qob" that protects from sun and sand.

                        <p class="clothing-text">The gandora (or kandora) is a lighter, ankle-length tunic worn by men, especially during summer months. Unlike the djellaba, it has no hood and features shorter, wider sleeves. Often embroidered around the neckline and down the front, gandoras come in various colors and patterns.</p>

                        <p class="clothing-text">The caftan is a majestic, one-piece robe that has been worn by Moroccan women for centuries.

                            <p>Visit traditional souks and artisan cooperatives rather than tourist shops. Cities like Fez, Marrakech, and Rabat have dedicated artisan quarters where you can find authentic garments and even watch craftspeople at work.</p>

                            <p>Traditional Moroccan garments often require special care. Hand-embroidered pieces should be dry cleaned or hand washed gently. Store caftans and formal attire on padded hangers to maintain their shape.</p>
