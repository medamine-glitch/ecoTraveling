                        <h3>The Imperial City</h3>
                        <p>Founded in the 11th century by the Almoravids as a military settlement, Meknes rose to prominence in the 17th century when Sultan Moulay Ismail chose it as his capital. Under his 55-year reign, the city was transformed into a spectacular Spanish-Moorish style imperial city with monumental gates, massive walls, and expansive palaces that earned it the nickname "Versailles of Morocco."</p>
                        <p>Today, Meknes is one of Morocco's four imperial cities (along with Marrakech, Fez, and Rabat) and a UNESCO World Heritage site. While less frequented by tourists than its imperial counterparts, Meknes offers visitors an authentic experience of Moroccan history and culture without the crowds, making it an ideal destination for sustainable tourism.</p>

                        <h3>A City of Contrasts</h3>
                        <p>Meknes is characterized by its dual nature: the historic medina with its labyrinthine streets and ancient monuments, and the modern Ville Nouvelle established during the French protectorate. The city is surrounded by fertile agricultural land, particularly known for its olive groves and vineyards, which contribute to its reputation for excellent cuisine.</p>
                        <p>Unlike some of Morocco's more tourist-oriented cities, Meknes maintains a relaxed, authentic atmosphere where visitors can experience everyday Moroccan life. The city's strategic location also makes it an excellent base for exploring nearby attractions such as the Roman ruins of Volubilis and the holy town of Moulay Idriss.</p>

                        <p class="card-text">Considered one of the most beautiful gates in Morocco and among the largest in North Africa, Bab Mansour was completed in 1732 and named after its architect, El-Mansour. The monumental gate is adorned with intricate zellij (mosaic tilework), marble columns repurposed from the Roman ruins of Volubilis, and elaborate calligraphy.</p>
                        <p class="card-text">The gate served as the main entrance to the imperial city and Sultan Moulay Ismail's palace compound. Today, it stands as a testament to the architectural grandeur of Meknes during its golden age. While visitors cannot pass through the gate itself, they can enter through a smaller side entrance that now houses an art gallery.</p>

                        <p class="card-text">This sacred site houses the tomb of Sultan Moulay Ismail, the founder of imperial Meknes. Unlike many religious sites in Morocco, the mausoleum is open to non-Muslim visitors, offering a rare opportunity to experience the stunning Moroccan religious architecture with its fountained courtyard, tranquil gardens, and intricately decorated tomb chamber.</p>
                        <p class="card-text">Visitors are expected to dress modestly and remove their shoes before entering the tomb chamber. The atmosphere is one of peaceful reverence, with the beautiful craftsmanship of the carved plaster, cedar ceilings, and zellij tilework creating a space of remarkable beauty.</p>

                        <p class="card-text">These massive granaries and stables were built by Sultan Moulay Ismail to store food for his 12,000 horses and the city's population in case of siege. The ingenious design included a sophisticated ventilation system and an underground water channel that helped regulate temperature and humidity, preserving grain for years.</p>
                        <p class="card-text">Though partially destroyed by an 18th-century earthquake, the remaining structures are still impressive, with massive stone arches and thick walls demonstrating the advanced engineering capabilities of the era. Adjacent to the granaries is the Agdal Basin, a huge water reservoir that was part of the city's water management system.</p>

                        <p class="card-text">The ancient walled city of Meknes offers a more relaxed and authentic experience than the medinas of Marrakech or Fez. Its narrow streets are filled with traditional craftspeople, local markets, and architectural treasures including fondouks (traditional inns), hammams (public baths), and historic mosques.</p>
                        <p class="card-text">The main commercial thoroughfare, Souq Nejjarine, is lined with shops selling everything from traditional crafts to everyday items. Unlike more tourist-oriented medinas, Meknes' old city caters primarily to locals, providing visitors with a glimpse into authentic daily life in Morocco.</p>

                        <p class="card-text">This large square serves as the heart of Meknes, connecting the old medina with the imperial city. Built by Sultan Moulay Ismail as a place for royal announcements and public gatherings, it now functions as a vibrant social hub where locals and visitors alike gather, especially in the evenings.</p>
                        <p class="card-text">The square is surrounded by caf√©s and restaurants, and hosts a daily market selling fresh produce, spices, and crafts. In the evenings, the space comes alive with food vendors, storytellers, and musicians, offering a smaller and more relaxed version of Marrakech's famous Jemaa el-Fnaa.</p>

                        <p class="card-text">Housed in a beautifully preserved 19th-century palace, this museum showcases traditional Moroccan arts and crafts. The building itself is a masterpiece of Moroccan architecture, with its central courtyard garden, ornate reception rooms, and intricate decorative details.</p>
                        <p class="card-text">The museum's collections include traditional ceramics, jewelry, textiles, and woodwork from the region, as well as reconstructed rooms showing how wealthy Moroccan families lived in the late 19th century. The ornate reception hall with its painted cedar ceiling and the Andalusian-style garden provide a glimpse into Morocco's artistic heritage.</p>
